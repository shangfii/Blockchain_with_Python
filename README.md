# Blockchain_with_Python


The goal fo this exercise is: 


1. Build a functional blockchain that eases and records transactions.

2. Deploy a blockchain as a usable web application.

3. Securely decentralize the blockchain through proof of work, which is a consensus algorithm that blockchain networks commonly use.


# Technologies used

This project leverages [python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.8.5 with the following packages and modules:

1. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io);  Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes


2. [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times


3. [Dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) This module provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated


4. [Typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing) This module provides runtime support for type hints


5. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.


6. [Hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms
